A set of steep steps, each made of a rough hewn timber mortared into the wall, leads down into gloom. 

At the bottom a wine celler sprawls into the dark. Clusters of small glowing mushrooms form a faint line leading into the gloom.

#### Secret

Scattered through out the wine celler, are bottles of exceptional vintage, worth a small fortune to those who know.
