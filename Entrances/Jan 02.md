## Landmark

A set of steep steps, each made of a rough-hewn timber mortared into the wall, leads down into gloom. 

At the bottom a wine cellar sprawls into the dark. Clusters of small glowing mushrooms form a faint line leading into the gloom.

## Hidden

The path of glowing mushrooms leads to the far end of the wine cellar and a hole in the crumbling masonry. Beyond a rusted iron chain dangles into the gloom, in white chalk above the hole someone has scrawled "To the catacombs".

## Secret

Scattered through out the wine cellar, are bottles of exceptional vintage, worth a small fortune to those who know.
