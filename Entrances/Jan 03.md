## Landmark

A crack in the massive stone blocks of the Cyclopean **Old District** is outlined in splashes of red paint. Pitons have been hammered into the side of the crack, strands of frayed rope still cling to some of them.

## Secret

Under the splashes of red paint are notes scrawled in a dark red ink, the provided guidance on how best to descend and directions to stashed goods for members of the **Raincry Guild**.
