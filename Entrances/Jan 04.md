## Landmark

A large **Vartha Tree** has been split open by age or disaster, and shards of it's crystal fruit lay scattered in the soil at it's base.

The tree seems to have split open atop a hole that deceneds down deep into the earth. From within you can spell the telltale dank musty air of *The Below*

## Hidden

* Several of the shards are still in pristine shape and worth a few silvers.
* The sap hasn't yet hardened into the pitch, meaning the tree split recently.

## Secret

In the soil are a number of **Vartha** seeds, crystaline gems that will when planted and teneded too grow into trees of their own.
