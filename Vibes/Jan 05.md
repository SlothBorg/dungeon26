## The Old Passageways

The series of tunnels, forgotten rooms, sunken cellors and other structures that sit below **The City's** basements, sewers and streets. Often accsesable from basements and sewers the locations are well mapped and more often then not blocked or gaurded.

### Sights & Structures

Twisting passages of old masonry and crummbling stone. Dusty rooms filled with forgoten futniture. Damp winecellers sunken into the volcanic ash.

### Sounds

The twisting nature of the **Old Passageways** blocks or distorts most sounds, the groan of old stone and far off thuds and distoreted noises. 

### Smell and taste

Damp, dust, rot punctuated by the sharp salty bitterness of niter.

### Lighting

Only what you bring with you.

### Common monsters

Skeletons, trash and rot, forgotten things. Those who wish to hide, cultists and the like.
