## The Old Passageways

The series of tunnels, forgotten rooms, sunken cellars and other structures that sit below **The City's** basements, sewers, and streets. Often accessible from basements and sewers the locations are well mapped and more often than not blocked or guarded.

### Sights & Structures

Twisting passages of old masonry and crumbling stone. Dusty rooms filled with forgotten furniture. Damp wine cellars sunken into the volcanic ash.

### Sounds

The twisting nature of the **Old Passageways** blocks or distorts most sounds, the groan of old stone and far off thuds and distorted noises. 

### Smell and Taste

Damp, dust, rot punctuated by the sharp salty bitterness of niter.

### Lighting

Only what you bring with you.

### Common Monsters

Skeletons, beings of trash and rot, those who wish to hide, cultists, and the like.
