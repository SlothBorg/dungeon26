## Landmark

The door opens on to a large room of flagstone, on the far side a troll hunches over a stew pot singing in to itself, the air is heavy with the sent of onions cooking in fat.

The troll turns to you, and grins!

"Ahhh! Hello there, food-things. Just in time! Please hop into the pot for me!"

*The troll is not openly hostile, and will do his best to convince you to become part of his stew. He's open to alternative meat sources.

## Hidden

Scattered through out the kitchen are a number of valuable herbs and plants.

## Secret

The troll's clever is magically ever sharp.
