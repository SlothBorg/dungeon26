## Landmark

The flagstone hall ahead is dimly lit by glowing fungus hanging from the ceiling. Many of the flagstones are cracked or missing, exposing a dark void below. A foul acrid stench rises up from the floor.

## Hidden

Most BUT not all the flagstones are weakened and will collapse under a heavy load. They fall away into a pit below in which several large cab grubs wait for their next meal.

## Secret

Among the refuse in the grubs lair, many items of utilitarian value can be found. All are pitted and corroded from the acid slime.
