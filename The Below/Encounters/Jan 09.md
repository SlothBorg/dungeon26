## Landmark

A long hall stretches before you, the walls pitted and chipped, the floor stained with filth and what looks like blood.

Thread bear banners hang from the wall, the place smells of rot and fresh meat though lacks any obvious source.

## Hidden

Behind the banners are arrow slits and a pack of Gnolls waits eagerly with crossbows ready to ambush any who come though.

## Secret

The banners if studied give clues to a random player's Quest.
