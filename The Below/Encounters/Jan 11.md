## Landmark

The tunnel opens into a small room, a few mushrooms grow in scattered clumps of dirt. In the center an Orc has been tied to a beam wedged against the calling and floor, a sign dagoes from its neck. Judging from the dried blood the orc has been here quiet some time.

## Hidden

When approached the orc groans and tries to look up but is too injured and weary. 
The sign is crude, it reads "BACK! Our land now!"
The Orc's tribe has been fighting with a gang of newly arrived gnolls. 

## Secret

The mushrooms are a potent antivenom.
