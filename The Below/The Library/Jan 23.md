## Landmark

Another dusty, dimly lit, room full of bookshelves and scattered notes. A strange scent hangs in the air but otherwise nothing of note.

## Hidden

The scent of acid and oil mingles and masks the subtler herbal scent of night rose.

## Secret

If the light of an open flame is shed within this room, writings starts to glow subtly at first and then more brightly until it can easily be read in full darkness. The process takes a full minute, and will stop when the flame is extinguished and then last at that brightness for an hour before winking out.

The writings are the ramblings of a scholar driven mad, they concern Serbastoz and the processes by which they became a lich.
