## Landmark

The door swings open to a large amphitheater, you stand at the top on one side of the crescent shaped room. The walls are lined with bookshelves and the seats empty. On the raised dais at the bottom of the amphitheater a group of orcs sits around a small fire they seem to be cutting up a large tree and feeding it into the flames.

You shudder at the open flames and noise. As you watch a door on the opposite side opens and a shambling mummy enters hissing curses and condemnation of the fire. 

## Hidden

The tree that the orc's are chopping up is in fact the corpse of a trent. 

## Secret

There are several hidden doors behind bookshelves within the room.
