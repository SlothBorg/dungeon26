## Landmark

### The Locked Annex

A large wooden door is locked, a thick chain crosses it with a heavy padlock. A crude sign reads "Keep out!"

Beyond is a series of rooms around a large lecture hall, the hall has been converted to a shantytown with open cooking fires. Goblins are everywhere.

## Hidden

The Golins while hated by the librarians are a great source of outside goods and so "tolerated" as long as they are useful. The goblin market is a mix of scams, useful items, information, and trinkets. 


## Secret

Serbastoz grants the high priest of them limited magic in return for his devotion. This was part of a now abandoned experiment but Serbastoz is amused by it and allows it to continue.
