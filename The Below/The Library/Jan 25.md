### Adventuring Library 

Above the large wooden door, carve into the stone "Grimtooth's Adventuring Library". The handled polished by countless hands, a closed sign hangs from a frayed rope. 

The door opens on well oiled hinges, inside is a long hall stretches into the gloom. Shelves of gear line the walls down the center of the room are tables and display cases. From the ceiling dangle trophies of slain monsters.

As you step into the room, candles set into the walls flicker to life with pale blue flame. The scent of burning dust and cobwebs fills the air, from the far end of a the hall there is a loud crackling pop and a large orc pops into existences coughing in the dust. 

"Greetings and *cough* welcome to *cough* *cough* *sneeze*, welcome to *deep breath* GRIMTOOTH'S ADVENTURING LIBRARY!. That's me, I'm Grimtooth!"
