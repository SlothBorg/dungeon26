## Landmark

A bronze door, symbols etched into its surface barley visible under a layer of dust and oxidation, opens into the damp room. Walls of rough-hewn stone, no books in sight an odd contrast to this place. The room is sunken with circular steps descending on all sides. The floor is 5 steps lower than where you are now. 

The floor is marked by concentric rings of bronze worked into the stone and at the center a plinth made of jagged obsidian, on top rests an unremarkable clay tablet.

## Hidden

The bands of bronze worked into the floor are etched with symbols of binding.
The tablet itself is plain and unadorned, it is a written record of a transaction for copper.

## Secret

At the tablet's core is a single sheet of beaten copper etched with a spell of binding holding within a powerful spirit.
