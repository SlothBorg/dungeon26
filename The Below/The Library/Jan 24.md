## Landmark

The bookshelves in this alcove are free of dust, spider webs but oddly look bristle as if they might collapse into dust.

## Hidden

The short sword is intelligent, craving he life energy of living beings. It will slate it's hunger with inanimate objects if it must but loathes to do so, if fed on undead it will instead drain the wielders life energies and empower the undead. 


## Secret

The sword will grow when fed and is one of only a few items that can safely disrupt Serbastoz's phylactery.
