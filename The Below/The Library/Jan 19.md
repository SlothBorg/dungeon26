## Landmark

The wall between two bookshelves is cracked and a damp cool breeze issues forth. Looking at it, it's clear that a bookshelf had been in the empty space but rotted away over countless years.

The crack seems large enough to wiggle though.

The space behind the wall opens onto a cave filled with dark crystals, a giant geode. In the darkness a strange constellation of symbols flickers within the larger crystals. 

## Hidden

These constellation are arcane in nature, sharing common roots with several spells. With some study the could lead to powerful magics.

## Secret

The constellation is in fact a single living self aware spell locked away inside the crystals, one of Serbastoz's forgotten experiments. If cast it is willing to trade knowledge of Serbastoz's for freedom.
