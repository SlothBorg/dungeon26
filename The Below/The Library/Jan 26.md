## Landmark

Above the doorway, carved in plain letters, a sign ominously reads skeletons. 

Locked behind a heavy iron door, is a small chamber is dominated by a large wood and glass display case along the far wall. Eleven skeletons of different types are posed with gold wire, each bares a small brass plate with dust covered descriptions.

| Skeleton | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Dwarf miner |
| 2 | Elf sage |
| 3 | Orc barkeep |
| 4 | Human (I didn't bother to ask) |
| 5 | Ogre Mage (self professed) |
| 6 | Kobold (see 7) |
| 7 | Goblin (see 6) |
| 8 | Part of a dragon (or so I was told I doubt it... Larry is a liar) |
| 9 | Gith (unclear what species, specimen damaged and I don't care anymore) |
| 10 | This plaque is intentionally left blank because I don't like you! |
| 11 | Larry LIAR |
| 12 | Space saved for later use |

## Hidden

The 11th skeleton can still answer questions via *Speak with Dead* will spend most of its time ranting about "That damn fool wizard" who had him collecting skeletons.

The dragon bone is in fact part of a dragons spine and is a powerful alchemical substance.
