## Landmark

A narrow path extends 40 or 50ft between overflowing bookshelves. Paths branch off from this path before it turns to the left far ahead in the dim light. At the end of each bookshelf is a metal plaque with a word or short phrase written on it, below are a few letters and numbers. 

## Hidden

The words are categories and the letters and numbers are a catalog system for this portion of the library. It is reflected else where in the library. The maze is filled with the ghosts of those who died lost here and malicious librarians.

## Secret

The Lich's name Serbastoz Gromlay is the key to navigating the maze.
