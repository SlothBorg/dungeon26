## Landmark

The small door opens onto a large room, lanterns hang from the ceiling shedding a bright even light. A dozen tables are spread around a large circular bookshelf full of scrolls and codices.

On the table closest to you several maps are spread out overlapping.

## Hidden

Given enough time maps to most locations can be found, often you need secret information about that location for example it's original name, or what it was called by the mapmaker.

## Secret

Hidden within the bookshelf is a codex of the most complete map of the below, in additional to maps of existing areas it magically updates to include areas explored.
