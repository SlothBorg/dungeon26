## The Brass Bauble

An oasis within The Below, a mix of a tavern, brothel, gambling hall, temple and mercantile. 

### Sights & Structures

The floor of the first floor is made of large flat stones, upper floors use oak plans. The walls are high and arched, wooden beams and plaster. Everything is functional, with a layer of lived in grim, the calling has a layer of soot from cooking fires and lighting.

### Sounds

Loud and boisterous, filled with drunken singing and dancing and crackling fire.

### Smell and Taste

The air is filled with the scent of roasting foods, ale, and the undercurrent of sweat and tallow candles.

### Lighting

Large chandlers of tallow candles hang from the calling, a long low pit full of red hot coals and dancing flames used for cooking fills the main room other rooms use oil lamps and candles.
