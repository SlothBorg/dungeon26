## Landmark

### The Main Hall

The door swings open onto a large hall, warmth, and the scent of cooking foods and ale floods over you. Drunken song and the babble of countless voices fills your ears.

The Room is long with a lowered central part dominated by a large low hearth flames dance on red hot coals under many stew pots and roasting spits. Around it on a raised section are tables filled with patrons drinking, talking, and gambling. On the far side you can see a wooden dance floor with a few dozen patrons. In a large semicircular alcove to your right is a long bar made of a massive tree trunk patrons lean against it waiting for drinks. On the left archways lead off into a smaller rooms.
