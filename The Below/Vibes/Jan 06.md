## Grand Catacombs

Long ago the volcanic rock of the caldera were quarried to build the fist buildings of **The City**. Now these winding tunnels, narrow shafts, and vaulted caverns have been repurposed to hold the dead. A vertical walled shaft leads straight from **The City** to **The Grand Lichyard** a misleading name for the open pit in which the cities dead are throw to feaster and rot.

A multitude of small passage wind their way from churches down into the catacombs.

### Sights & Structures

In the few places where the walls are not obscured by bones, the walls are chiseled black volcanic stone. Bones are knit together to form decorative structures or piled deep into niches. In those rare cases where a room is dedicated to a single group or even person, the entries are protected. 

### Sounds

The winding nature of the tunnels and piles of bones distorts and dampens noises in the catacombs. The sound of funerary rites drift though tunnles twisting and distorting into an eerie mockery.

### Smell and Taste

The air is generally dry and filled with the scent of rot, incense, and candles clings to the walls. The air tastes of dust and the acrid smoke.

### Lighting

The occasional brazier, or rarer shaft bringing sunlight into the crypts are the only light.

### Common Monsters

The undead, necromancers, those terrible beasts that feast upon the flesh of the dead.
