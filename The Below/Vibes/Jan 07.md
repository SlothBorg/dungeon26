## Endless Sea of Last Twilight

### Sights & Structures

Black calm water, in the depths echos of stars cast a dim light akin to twilight. Sharp rocks jut from the sea, around which rickety towns have been built on stilts or from ship wrecks. Ships prowl the waves hunting, the mightest of these are clad in metal and said to be living beings born of **The Cataclysm**.

### Sounds

Lapping of waves, the far off noises of wales surfacing, faint calls of sea birds.

### Smell and Taste

Smells and tastes of the sea, salt fills the air, the rot of seaweed 


### Lighting

In the depths of the sea bright echos of stars still cast light, at the far edges a glow of the setting stun lingers.


### Common Monsters

The lords of the council of 11 (aboliths, beholders, and mindflayers). Dish-folk, sea creatures of old that have gone "wrong", fishermen, fishmongers, dock hands, and similar folk caught in an endless dream from beyond, and vicious mockers of sea birds with beaks and talons of metal.
