# The Sprawl

The portion of **The City** that spills up and over the caldera edge running down into the open fields that boarder **The Wilds**

### Sights & Structures

Hustle and bustle of dense urban life, buildings are haphazardly built often learning against one another. The jumble of architectural styles on display is staggering even as it dissolves into one chaotic background.

### Sounds

There is always noise, the loud din of work and people hawking wears during the day. As night approaches it fads to drunken song, closing of doors and shutters, music floats on the air and whispered conversations are just around the corner.

### Smell and Taste

There is always the taste of smoke on the air no matter what else might dominate. The air is thick with the smell of refuse and urban living, in some lucky areas it is drowned out by the smells of various industries, dye making, baking, scathing, etc.

### Lighting

During the day it's largely natural at night, oil lamps and the rare *Lightning Glass* shed light.
