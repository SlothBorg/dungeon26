# Dungeon 26

## This is a collection of rooms, encounters, and such for a MegaDungeon. One per day, each with a theme:

* **Entrances**
* **Liminal spaces** the spaces inbetween main events, hall ways, minor details etc.
* **Traps / Obstacles**
* **NPCs & Social Encounters**
* **Environmental Hazards** 
* **Treasures**
* **Rest Areas**
* **Lore**
* **Puzzles**
* and more as I think of them...

The goal is to stop worrying about a perfect template, system, etc and just write stuff for a dungeon. We shall see how well I hold to that.
